Level design assignment completed during my enrollment in a game design study program at Mentor.
<br>
For this assignment I was given a prebuilt casual game, but without any levels. It was up to me to edit the attached gameplay.js file and code in the levels.

The game is played on a grid filled with movable blocks, one of which is a chocolate bar, that each slide along a single axis, vertical or horizontal.
An adorable monster sits to one side of the table, and the object of the game is to move away any blocks that are in the way and slide the chocolate bar into the monster's mouth.
<br>
It's a take on the classic board game Rush Hour.

Under some substantial constraints in terms of what I could affect, I worked to create engaging, unique, and challenging levels, using the building blocks I was given.

For each level, I controlled:
* the size of the playing grid, from 4X4 to 6X6.
  * since onboarding was statedly not part of the assignment, I opted to use larger boards with room for more elaborate design.
* the starting location of the chocolate bar and the blocking pieces.
* which axis each blocking piece slides on.
* the length of each blocking piece; 2-3 squares.

#### See the game yourself!
You will find in this repository the 2 files needed to run this project; a gameplay.js data file and a Muncher.swf launcher file. If you have the ability to run Flash files, you will be able to fully try the levels for yourself. However, Flash is no longer in common use, and you might not be able to conveniently run the project.

For those who can't run the game, I have prepared images of the levels and video recordings of their solutions, so you can still engage with the game and enjoy the results of my design!
